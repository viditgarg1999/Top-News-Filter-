Top News Filter  using News Api in pyhton

Hii..
With the help of this python code you will be able to filter top business, tech,bitcoin etc. news

How to use this?
You just have to copy this entire program in your python IDE(IDLE,PYCHARM etc.) 
and then login to "newsapi.org" website which will generate an API for you. Now just replace the "Enter your Api here" text 
in the code with that API.
That's all.

Hope you find it useful.
